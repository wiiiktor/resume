{"question": "I just got a Redline d660 29er, I know you don't support dirt riding but the limit of my dirt riding is a grand total of 15-20 feet of gravel driveway at the beginning and end of my rides. Right now it is a single on the crank and 9 speed cassette.  Thank you  Dan", "answer": "Dear Dan, I check specs here: http://redlinebicycles.com/bikes/2015-d660/ If this bike uses a PressFit 92, then it is not an English-threaded BB - we provide a BB with an English thread. I see here: http://www.bikebug.com/images/Sizing_Charts/BB86_BB92_Diag.jpg that the BB Shell is 91.5mm - we have a version for 68.0mm. Seems like you would have to make a custom BB to replace the one, you would receive from us. This is possible, but obviously not very easy. Sorry that I can not offer you a proper version today, but we target the widest segment, which is necessary for a start-up."}
{"question": "Hi, and thanks for the fascinating invention. I see that you are recommending installation of the efneo on 68 mm bottom brackets. So it definitely won't work on a 70 mm italian-thread square taper bb? I confess I can't see why this would present a problem if the gear box is simply bolted to the 70-mm bb that I already have installed. Thank you so much for a clarification. -RM", "answer": "Dear Rod, we provide a bottom bracket with the gearbox. This bottom bracket has an axle of a specified length and a special right BB cup, so your BB will probably not be good. I am sorry about that."}
{"question": "Hello. My bike has an Italian style 36mm diameter bottom bracket with right hand thread on both sides. Will I be able to use the efneo system with this bike?", "answer": "Dear Jeff, we are going to provide a Bottom Bracket of an English type, 68mm wide. It has a specific axle length (30.5mm on the drive side, beyond the BB right surface) and a BB Cup with an external diameter 46mm & 2.5mm thickness (there may be slight changes in these dimensions). IF you can make such a bottom bracket yourself, then yes, you can use our gearbox. But unfortunately, we are not going to make the Italian version."}
{"question": "Could you please confirm if this will fit a 1996 Trek 930.  Thank you. Eric", "answer": "Dear Eric, I see here: http://www.bikepedia.com/quickbike/BikeSpecs.aspx?year=1996&brand=Trek&model=930 that it has 73mm-wide BB Shell. This is not the good one, as we only provide 68mm-side Bottom Bracket version (73mm version is for mtb, and we provide a product for city / urban use, which uses 68mm-wide BBs). Can you please measure the BB width, like here, in the point 2. Bottom Bracket Sizing? https://www.nashbar.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/CustomContentView?storeId=10053&catalogId=10052&dynamicSpotName=sizeforbikeSpot_Part1 2. Bottom Bracket Sizing There are 2 components to Bottom Bracket (BB) size, the BB shell width of the frame and the spindle length. Bottom Bracket shell width: The BB shell is the frame tube into which the BB threads. It will measure 68mm, 70mm or 73mm wide. Measuring the shell is easy. Flip the bike upside down and use a metric ruler or calipers to measure across the shell on a line parallel to the BB spindle. Do not measure any of the old BB if it protrudes beyond the shell. This measurement will also determine which threading your frame is likely to have. 68mm & 73mm shells have English threading while 70mm is Italian. Below are pictures of how to measure shell width. The first picture shows the measurement being taken without the BB installed (left), the second is with the BB installed (right): [image: Bottom Bracket Shell Width]"}

Would the GTRO Efneo drive work with my bike? I think it should. I am not concerned about the bottom bracket requirements of 68 mm and English thread but rather about the front cog and how well to install it. The Gates manual doesn’t approve a 28T front cog with a 24T rear cog. So I am not sure how your drive could possibly work in my bike. However, one of the bike owners in your website testimonials also has a NuVinci hub but uses a bike chain instead of Gates belt so I thought perhaps there is hope for me.

I am willing to pay extra for a customized solution from you.", "answer": "Dear Nolin, the photos that you can see at our website show a Gates front beltring with 46 teeth (28 teeth chainring is used for a standard chain, so this is a different world ;) ).

You can use this beltring with our adapter; we do not sell Gates components: https://www.amazon.com/Gates-Carbon-Drive-CenterTrack-Pulley/dp/B00FUS1MTA.

{"question": "Franek and Wiktor,  Thank you for the quick delivery. The box was not damaged in transit. I am very pleased with the overall quality of the GTRO assembly.  The installation was surprisingly easy right up to the installation of the PAS.  I bought a new left side PAS with the Juliet 3 pin connector. The back of the sensor slides into the splines on the bottom bracket end cap.  It appears this sensor is meant to be on a smaller diameter axle.  The ID of the magnet wheel inside the PAS is 0.62\".  The GTRO axle transitions from the 4 flat sides to the fully round shaft about 1/4\" before the bottom bracket end cap. The diameter of the round portion is about 0.665\"  The old shaft also does a transition but the resulting diameter is 0.625\" (I'm using a dial caliper so my dimensions may be a bit off.)  The new PAS is just too small to press onto the portion of the shaft where it needs to be.  I've included several pictures to show show what I am trying to explain.  I was able to mount my old PAS on the left side using the extra nut you supplied. It looked like your Sondor pics. The fingers on the inside of the magnet wheel can be stretched over the GTRO shaft.  Unfortunately, it didn't work. It turned out that I bent one of the pins in the Juliet connector. When I tried to straighten the pin, it broke off.  I am temporarily dead in the water until I figure out a new PAS solution.  Meanwhile I'll mount the shifter on the handlebar. I think I'll need to remove a few extra chain links as I transitioned from a 42T to the GTRO 28T.  You may want to look over the shaft diameter issue for future ebike installations. I found a dimensional drawing of the PAS I went with. I've included it in the attachments. There is no information on the ID and I'm wondering if there is some standard dimension they are designing to.  I'll let you how things go.  Cheers,  Fel Micco", "answer": "Dear Felice,   1) BBs have different axle diameters, but you can use this kind of PAS, which is more flexible (however, I have not checked, if it has the 3 pin connector):  https://www.ebay.com/itm/Electric-Bike-Power-Pedal-Assisted-Sensor-PAS-Voltage-Mode-eBike-Assistant/142710094324 2) you need to take out 6 or 8 chain links (it has to be an even number), with a tool like this: https://www.ebay.com/itm/Bike-Bicycle-Chain-Cutter-Splitter-Breaker-Repair-Rivet-Link-Pin-Remover-Tool-C/333592141090"}

{"question": "Hi Wiktor,   I am a little confused regarding installing the efneo gearbox on a Sondors fat tire e-bike.  I removed and attempted to re-install the PAS sensor from the right to the left side. The problem I have is the bottom bracket retainer on the left side screws in so far that there is no mounting available for the sensor bracket or the retaining ring for it.   I attempted to reposition the bottom bracket by removing the spacer on the right side of the bottom bracket, but the bottom bracket retainer on the left side still goes too far in to leave any mounting surface or threads to attach the ring.   Does this make sense?

In first gear there is a stiffness in the crank on about the third time around and more frequently in second and in third it is stiff most of the time.

{"question": "Dear Wiktor, thanks for your answers. Point 2 is now clarified. I don‘t know whether the screws will withstand the torque of 60 Nm in case of the eBike Tandem and if there is enough place for a second chainring. Do you think that the place for a second chainring will be big enough?  Point 1 is still unclear because the only cable stop on the Santana tandem is on the side of the steering tube. That means that this is the end of the outer casing and the rest of the wire runs without cable housing to the Efneo gearbox. As I can see on the manuals and Videos of the Efneo gearbox there is alway a cable housing going into the gearbox and not a wire without an cable housing. Hope you understand the problem.  As you can see on the foto the shifting cable will be guided under the bottom bracket and has no cable housing but just the wire. This will be the place where the wire will run into the Efneo gearbox as I understand.  So in this case the cable runs into the gearbox directly without cable housing.  In addition to that I am not sure if you are offering a 73 mm bottom bracket. I only can find a 68 mm bottom bracket which is not compatible with the 73 mm bottom bracket shell. Right?  Just to Pont it out very clearly: I‘m highly interested in the Efneo gearbox especially for tandems, because I can see a lot of advantages. But - as you can see - some points are very special in the Tandem business.  Hope you can help me.  Kind regards Bernhard  Quidquid agis, prudenter agas et respice finem!", "answer": "Dear Bernhard,  1) yes, I think there is enough place around the crank disc, to mount a chainring  2) cable housing is not necessary for the gearbox to work; shifting wire can go into our \"separator pipe\" directly, without the housing around, as shown on page 3: http://efneo.com/filesss/manuals/Shifting-cable-exchange---grip-or-trigger.pdf  3) yes, we do offer 73mm-wide Bottom Bracket"}

{"question": "On Friday, soon after I ordered a 20” Kent Cavalier Recumbent bike, I discovered the Efneo web site!  I was looking for a way to expand the 7-speed rear derailleur setup that it comes with, and your GTRO Gearbox seemed to be the perfect solution.  My only hesitation is, of course, whether your GTRO might be compatible with the Kent!  Back in my younger years, I had a 15-speed Schwinn Paramount that I thoroughly enjoyed.  However, I must admit that the front derailleur could be a problem when I forgot to wrap the right leg of my bellbottomed jeans! Now, in my mid-70’s, neuropathy and other balance issues require that I get my exercise (and fun) on more than 2 wheels. I chose the Kent recumbent because it’s more upright position (and lower price) seemed more suitable for me.  I just wanted an option that would allow me to increase it's speed range.  That was how I found your web site!  The bike is scheduled to arrive at my home this Thursday.  I will be glad to measure the pedal bracket and any other dimensions that would be helpful.  Just let me know what information you need to determine whether your GTRO might be compatible!

{"question": "Hello again Wiktor .  Already have an EFNEO FGB on my Tiawanese Strida clone - which generally works well, but occasionally the drive slips when changing to gear 3, under high pedal torque.  Not a real issue, as now I tend to back-pedal for a quarter rev before reapplying high torque immediately after selecting 2>3.  My main question today (before buying an electric bike, with no rear-wheel gearing)  is 'how do I check that the new BB shell is the correect internal size to receive the EFNEO beltwheel hub' which I already own?  The Bike I am looking to buy is the *Haco OUXI V5 folding ebike*, without the external Shumano rear-wheel gears.  Would also need to exchange my beltwheel for a suitable chain wheel to mount on my EFNEO crank-spindle  housing.  Please advise which compatable EFNEO chain-drive wheels are available, the no of teeth and appropriate purchase prices please.  Finally,  what are the ideal shell  dimensions to receive the standard EFNEO hub wirh crank spindle already in place?  An EFNEO hub G/A diagram would also be useful  Also, if you can't assist, where should I search to locate the BB shell dimensions (of Chinese electric bikes) that I must have before deciding to buy the Chinese ebike?  Thanks for any practical help you can give.  Regards  Alistair F", "answer": "Dear Alistair,  1) The EFNEO beltwheel hub requires a BSA Bottom Bracket Shell with a width of either 68mm, 73mm, 80mm, or 100mm and an outer diameter below 45.5mm. Additionally, the BB Shell should be clean from welding or any other colliding elements, such as the rear chainstay or kickstand.  2) The 130BCD adapter that you already have in your gearbox can be used to mount most of the 38T chainrings available on the market. With a 38T chainring on the gearbox, you would have an equivalent of a triple front derailleur like 38-54-68T, which should be sufficient even for a folding bike with small wheels. We do not have specific information on the number of teeth or purchase prices for compatible EFNEO chain-drive wheels. It is recommended to check with EFNEO or a local bike shop for more information.  3) The ideal shell dimensions to receive the standard EFNEO hub with the crank spindle already in place would be the same as mentioned in point 1 (BSA Bottom Bracket Shell with a width of either 68mm, 73mm, 80mm, or 100mm and an outer diameter below 45.5mm). Unfortunately, we do not have a G/A diagram of the EFNEO hub.  If we are unable to assist you, we recommend searching for the BB shell dimensions of the Haco OUXI V5 folding ebike or other Chinese electric bikes on the manufacturer's website or contacting the manufacturer directly.  Please let us know if you have any further questions."}
{"question": "Wiktor,  Hope you are doing well. Finally spring here in the central  midwest USA.  First I have gotten to ride with the new Efneo drive. So it has been a while since I purchased it.  If you recall I had several installation problems. Some were corrected with the longer BB spindle you sent me. But the drive still had much more drag turning the crank by hand in the second and third gears. Also some gear noise. It did not sound good or seem right .  During my first ride in the neighborhood I heard two pops in short order from the drive. Something must be now lined up as the crank arms turn with much less resistance and is quiet.  I do not know if others have experienced this. I am now experiencing the benefit of a much improved gear range.

{"question": "Hello Wiktor,  My name is Steve, and I'm writing to you from the Pocono Mountains in Pennsylvania USA. Just over a year ago I bought a Radmission from Rad Power Bikes for the sole purpose of riding around my neighborhood to get exercise.  However it wasn't long before I found myself using it to commute 10 miles one way to my job. My problem is that the bike only has one gear and my ride home is pretty much up hill the entire way.  After the warranty expired I upgraded my controller to a 35 amp controller which helped give me a little extra torque, but I'm still finding some hills are still very challenging, plus the added power from the controller is reducing the range of my battery.  I decided to try to find a solution to both problems and came across your website, and the GTRO gearbox.  While reviewing your website I saw that your product has been successfully installed on Rad Runners and Rad Minis. I was wondering if any of your customers have successfully installed your GTRO onto a Radmission...or if it is compatible at all?  I have attached screenshots of the Specs for my bike that I found on the internet. The PAS sensor on my bike, from what I can see, is already on the left crank, but would there need to be any further modification I would need to do in order for the GTRO to work.  I look forward to your response. Thank you in advance.  ALSO, the chat entry copy pasted here: My name is Steve. My email is sjanulin@yahoo.com. I was wondering if your gearbox is compatible with the Radmission. I see on your website that some of your customers successfully installed your product onto the Radrunner and the Radmini. I own a Radmission with a 50t front chainring, single speed drivetrain, and am looking for an upgrade that will help me negotiate the mountainous hills on my work commute in the Poconos in Pennsylvania. Your website came up in my research. I would be interested to hear your thoughts on: if your gearbox would work with my bike, and if the 28t or the 38 t would be a better option with my drivetrain. Thanks in advance. Steve", "answer": "Hello Steve,  We have not sold any gearbox to RadMission yet, as I see in our archive, so you would need to check if it is using a 68mm Bottom Bracket? If not, what length?  There is no modification needed apart from moving PAS to the left side  with 28T you would get an equivalent of a 28-40-50T triple, with 38T it would be 38-54-68T triple; if you need mainly additional lower gears, you could go for 28T, but we also have a special version that lets you make a change yourself: http://efneo.com/filesss/manuals/external-chainring-attachment.pdf If you're not sure, you can buy this option 28T+38T and decide later! :-) When making a purchase, please, write this in a comment: \"*Radmission, 28T + external 38T*\"  Let me know if you have any other questions"}
{"question": "Can you tell me more about the BB torque sensor?", "answer": "We offer THUN and SEMPU torque sensors; THUN costs 150 USD, SEMPU costs 100 USD (sorry for the steep price, but this is how our suppliers count for this ;) And yes, you need to purchase these BB sensors from us, so that we can make them compatible with the gearbox...)

{"question": "Hello I'm considering to build an ebike with efneo gear, belt drive and hub motor from ebike.ca (Grin). It will be an tianium frame(Commuter/Hardtail like with 29\" wheels)  I have read that you recommend the Sempu T2.3 Torque Sensor? ( https://endless-sphere.com/forums/viewtopic.php?t=114073). If yes can you sell it together with the gearbox? May you provide with CAD/Technial info so i can design my bike? ( I have fusion 360 but i will test bikeCAD and rattle CAD).  Thank you very much  BR Andy", "answer": "*Dear Andreas, * here are our 3D files: http://efneo.com/filesss/3d/ You probably need Chain.zip or Gates.zip Our BB has these dimensions: http://efneo.com/filesss/manuals/BB-68mm-dim.png You would need to purchase any BB, also BB torque sensor, from us, because of the right BB Cup We can currently offer you a THUN sensor for 150 USD (I know it is a lot, but this is simply due to a high price from THUN): THUN X-Cell RT 3.0*:* http://efneo.com/filesss/manuals/THUN_X-CELL_RT_3_0_Datasheet_2019.pdf http://efneo.com/filesss/manuals/Technical%20file%20Thun.pdf"}
{"question": "Hey People, I am currently building an E-Bike with a Qulbix 76 Frame, could I fit a GTRO to it?  Cheers Rasmus", "answer": "Dear Rasmus, we sell our gearboxes to https://vectorebike.com/  Their frame seems similar. What is the BB width in your frame? Is it 100mm? We have 100mm BBs in our offer. Are you going to use chain?"}
{"question": "Hi, I have a Gi Flybike that I am looking to fit a GTRO onto.  I need more dimensions. I'm pretty sure i can fit the GTRO onto the beltring, but i don't know if the right crank arm will have enough clearance. The distance from the outside of the beltring to the outside of the frame is roughly 33mm.  I've attached some photos that should hopefully help.  Thank you for your time, Jon", "answer": "Dear Johnatan, please, let me know: 1// what is the \"chainline\" of this bike (it is a measure from the middle plane of the bike frame to the middle of the belt; well, this should be called a \"beltline\") 2// what is the front beltring size (how many teeth it has) 3// is it the Gates CDX system  (with a middle flange on the beltring / sprocket?) 4// is this bike using a standard BSA bottom bracket? 68mm wide? 5// Does this bike have a home page, with specs available?.."}

{"question": "What size spacer do I need for my gear box to be installed on my babymaker to make the sprocket line up?", "answer": "Dear Kenneth, did you receive such a Bottom Bracket?: http://efneo.com/filesss/bb80.jpeg If yes, then 2mm washers are ok (if I understand correctly what you mean by 'spacer')"}

{"question": "Are these silver rings (see picture) meant to be placed between the right side of the bottom bracket and the bottom bracket cup (see picture) so you can place the gearbox more to the right side?", "answer": "Dear Thierry, correct, these washer distances are used to move gearbox away from the frame"}
{"question": "Hello Wiktor,  I have not heard from you since last September. You then wrote you would send me a new gear box within 2 or 3 months. 5 months later, I still have not heard from you. Is everything ok ? I do not mind waiting longer for a reliable gearbox. I just need to get informed. Maybe you simply have forgotten me !  Regards,  Laurent", "answer": "Dear Laurent,  yes, we will send you a new gearbox next week (only the right crank with cable and shifter, as I assume you have the Bottom Bracket and the left crank, yes?..)"}
