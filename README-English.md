This repository includes a few sample scripts that I wrote, from the area of both text and image processing:

1// rnn-2layer.py - RNN 2-layer network implementation using Python+NumPy; no use of PyTorch RNN class, all derivatives calculated using

2// lstm-2layer.py - LSTM 2-layer network implementation; no use of PyTorch LSTM class

3// cnn-bs1.py - CNN network working with batch_size=1, which required using alternative to a standard solution of BatchNorm layer

4// salesman.py - my try on the famous TSP / Travelling Salesman Problem, with visualisation
